A few months ago I saw somewhere on Twitter that somebody developed a voice controller record player. That’s inspired me to try to make a voice-controlled midi device. I was very excited so it took only about two relaxed days to develop. Back in that days I only had one midi device LXR Digital Drum Synth so that’s why this project based on this machine.

The first one is just to watch short video demonstration to check how it works.

The other one is going deeper. Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/minikin/VoiceControlledDrumMachine) page of the project and try to make it by yourself. That’s not hard, you can do it!
