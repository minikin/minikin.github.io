About month ago, we launched with [Yuriy Oparenko](https://twitter.com/oparenko) a  macOS application [Sketch Cache Cleaner](https://github.com/yo-op/sketchcachecleaner) which can help to clean Sketch cache. 
The app has received more than 700 "Get it" on [Producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/sketch-cache-cleaner) and was downloaded more than 7000 times.
