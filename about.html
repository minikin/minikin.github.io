<p>I’m an engineer. I’ve been developing iOS applications from scratch almost for two years and launching different 'The Internet of Things’ projects for big clients for five years.</p>

<p>I have strong understanding of Object Oriented design and data structures, I have experience with multithreading programming using NSOperations, I develop at the user interface and system levels, I always analyse my applications with an Instruments to apply performance optimisations techniques and I can develop prototypes very quickly.</p>

<p>Sometimes things that I've done get attention from people and even collect some awards. 
When I have spare time <a href="https://soundcloud.com/minikin" target="_blank">I produce electronic music.</a></p>
