<p>I’m an engineer. I’ve been developing iOS applications from scratch with Swift for almost two years and launching different 'The Internet of Things’ projects for big clients for five years.</p>

<p>I have strong understanding of Object Oriented design and data structures, and experience with multithreading programming, I developing at the user interface and system levels, I always analyse my applications with Instruments to apply performance optimisation techniques and I can develop prototypes very quickly.</p>

<p>I’m really excited to learn more and see how I’ll be able to contribute to a project.</p>

<p>Sometimes things that I've done get attention from people and even collect some awards. 

When I have spare time <a href="https://soundcloud.com/minikin" target="_blank">I produce electronic music</a> or experimenting with <a href="https://github.com/minikin/Algorithmics" target="_blank">algorithms.</a></p>
