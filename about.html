<p>Hi, my name is Sasha Prokhorenko and I'm an engineer living near Stuttgart.
</br>
I’ve been developing iOS applications  with Swift for more than two years and launching different 'The Internet of Things’ projects for clients for more than five years.</p>

<p>I’m really excited to learn more and trying new things.</p>

<p>Sometimes things that I've done get attention from people and even collect some awards.

When I have spare time I produce <a href="https://soundcloud.com/minikin" target="_blank">electronic music</a> or playing with <a href="https://github.com/minikin" target="_blank">code</a> or traveling.</p>

<p>You can check my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio">portfolio</a> or look through my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume">resume</a>.</p>

<b>Technologies:</b><br>

Swift, iOS SDK, Xcode, CocoaPods, Realm, IoT, React/Redux, Node, Python, REST, JSON, Arduino, RaspberryPi, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, WebSockets, Ubuntu/Debian, Git, Travis, Sketch.
