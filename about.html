<p>I’m an engineer. I’ve been developing iOS applications from scratch with Swift for two years and launching different 'The Internet of Things’ projects for big clients for more than five years.</p>

<p>I’m really excited to learn more and trying new things.</p>

<p>Sometimes things that I've done get attention from people and even collect some awards.

When I have spare time I produce <a href="https://soundcloud.com/minikin" target="_blank">electronic music</a> or playing with <a href="https://github.com/minikin" target="_blank">code.</a></p>

<b>Technologies:</b><br>
