<p>Hi, my name is Sasha Prokhorenko and I'm an engineer living near Stuttgart.
</br>
I’ve been developing iOS applications  about 3 years and launching different  Internet of Things  projects for clients for more than six years.</p>
I’m really excited to learn more and trying new things.
<p>Sometimes things that I've done get attention from people and even collect some awards.

When I have spare time I produce <a href="https://soundcloud.com/minikin" target="_blank">electronic music</a>,
  playing with <a href="https://github.com/minikin" target="_blank">code</a> or traveling.</p>

<p>You can check my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/sasha_prokhorenko_portfolio.pdf">selected  portfolio</a>
or ask me to send you my <a  href="mailto:djminikin@gmail.com?Subject=Hi%20Sasha!" target="_top">djminikin@gmail.com</a> resume.</a></p>

<p>In case you have something to say to me,  feel free to contact:
