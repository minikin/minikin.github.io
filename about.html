<p>Hi, my name is Sasha Prokhorenko and I'm an engineer living in Berlin.
</br>
I’ve been developing iOS applications  about 4 years and launching different Internet of Things  projects for clients for more than six years.</p>
I’m really excited to learn more and trying new things. 
So I've been studing Data Scince about 6 months and been developing my side projects with React Native on Redux about half a year.
<p>Sometimes things that I've done get attention from people and even collect some awards.

When I have spare time I produce <a href="https://soundcloud.com/minikin" target="_blank">electronic music</a>,
  playing with <a href="https://github.com/minikin" target="_blank">code</a> or traveling.</p>
