<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kebab-oclock/id965015089" target="_blank">Kebab O'Clock</a> is a result of shared love for unhealthy high calorie delicious street food and a desire to create an iOS app. It’s also a educational exercise. All the code available on <a href="https://github.com/minikin/Kebab" target="_blank">Github</a>. I created this iOS application in collaboration with is a London-based digital product designer <a href="http://oparenko.com" target="_blank">Yuriy Oparenko</a></p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Brahm (BRAnd Health Monitor)</h2>
<blockquote>
We wanted to give a useful New Year gift to clients and thus to promote the agency and demonstrate our own competence in innovations and phygital design. Brand managers want to know what happens to their brands in the Internet without much effort.
</br>
To accomplish this we created a device that displays all the necessary information on one screen. Firstly, we've developed an algorithm that portrays all the relevant data about the brand in real time. Then we designed a wireless device that would look good on any work desk. This device is a touch screen on a compact stand

<p><b>Technical background:</b> </p>

<p>The solution for this task was quite simple.  As always, I had a very short period of time to prepare the project.
I decided to use an inexpensive android phone as the base. Major modifications were made to the android operating system (even changing the splash screen, power-off screens, etc.). After all these tweaks, it became a device which displayed only our data. It was impossible for a user to do anything else with the device. Unfortunately, at that moment, I didn't have enough time, knowledge, and budget to develop a native android app so I decided to use a third-party application which worked almost like an internet kiosk to display data from the Internet. It was possible to configure each device for a certain client.</br>
Later we decided to develop an iOS application with this BRAHM concept but unfortunately, the project was abandoned when 1/4th completed.

<h2 class="section-heading">Khortytsa Ice Maсhine</h2>
<blockquote>
	The innovation of Khortytsa Ice was a special bottle that changed its colour when chilled to +5 degrees Celsius (the ideal drinking temperature for this beverage). After consumers were invited to chill a bottle by themselves online, we came up with the idea of adapting this experience for offline use. Buyers needed to see that the bottle did change its colour at +5 degrees Celsius. A simple and, most importantly, safe way of instant chilling was required. Technical coordinators chose a conventional fire extinguisher, or rather, the properties of carbon dioxide which it contains. The temperature of CO2 vapours can be as low as -70 degrees, and that was more than enough to chill a bottle in 1 second.

<h2 class="section-heading">Pepsi Fridge</h2>

<blockquote>In winter when nobody thinks of cold drinks, we wanted to attract consumers’ attention to Pepsi. So we came up with an idea of creating an innovative fridge that reacts to passersby, talking and joking with people and giving them an original experience in the POS. This experience was designed to become a trigger for buying Pepsi in winter.</br>
We designed an innovation - the world’s first Pepsi Fridge that expresses emotions, has conversations, and makes friends online. The contact elements on its door send signals to the inboard computer. In response, the computer displays video and emits sounds through the speakers.

<p><b>Technical background:</b></p>

<p>I used  an Atmel microcontroller chip which was programmed to transform signals from a reed sensor on the door to midi data. After that, the received signal was transformed from midi data  to TCP/IP protocol inside a MAX/MSP, patch which was run on a macMini and triggered different videos from a local web server. Maybe you thought <i>"What a tricky architecture?”</i>, but I assure you, this system was very stable and didn't crash for almost one year while this fridge was operating  in a supermarket. </br>
That was a very successful & cost-effective choice.

<h2 class="section-heading">Hello Coffee Machine</h2>
<blockquote>
The same as in many other offices, every morning at Aimbulance starts with a cup of hot coffee. Often the check-in ritual precedes the process of drinking the first daily dose of caffeine. We decided to combine these two morning habits used in our office and transformed a common vending machine into a phygtal-coffee machine.

<h2 class="section-heading">Captain Morgan RFID</h2>
<blockquote>
We wanted to get the message across: «With Captain Morgan you’ll for sure have fun!».  That’s why we combined Captain Morgan fans in social networks with their life off-line, we came up with an interesting phygital-solution.
</br>
At a Captain Morgan party devoted to a Halloween feast there was launched RFID-activity. At the club entrance the participants registered via Facebook-account and received individual cards with RFID- chips. A special terminal, put in the club, allowed making pictures with Captain Morgan, checking-in, and posting check-in with picture on Facebook, making all missing the party feel envious.

<h2 class="section-heading">Khortitsa Ice into the stratosphere</h2>
<blockquote>
The innovative bottle for «Khortytsa Ice» changes its color when cooled to +5C (the ideal temperature for beverage drinking). We decided to demonstrate the gradual change of the bottle color in an original way - to send it into the stratosphere.
</br>
On the «Khortytsa Ice» space program site we offered users the opportunity to determine the altitude at which the bottle reaches its ideal temperature and changes color. Predictions could be posted on the site and on the Facebook network. After the successful launch of the measuring probe to an altitude of more than 25km, we were able to fix the altitude at which the bottle changed color and then decided the winner.
